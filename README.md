# Metroidvania-Prototype
Prototype for a metroidvania project

## Player Abilities
The player has a couple capabilities to help them. These capabilities are split into 2 forms: movement, and combat.

### Movement
1. Horizontal Movement: Move left or right using the "A" or "D" keys.
2. Jump: Jump into the air with either the "SPACE" key or the "W" key.
3. Double Jump: Can do a second jump while already in the air.
4. Wall Slide: Player contextually slides down walls.
5. Wall Jump: Player has the ability to jump from walls.

### Combat
1. Simple Attack: This is currently the only combat ability. (Executed by pressing ENTER)

## Builds
section about the builds of this project

### Current build
The current build is a complete prototype build, numbered build0.01. This build was made to test the basic concept and create basic player controls and enemies. player controls mostly work though animations aren't working properly for the player (notably the attack animation isn't working as intended with movement and jumping). Enemy AI still needs some more work as well, since it is frequently getting attached to walls and ledges.
